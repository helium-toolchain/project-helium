# CommandData handling

This is a conversion utility used to convert between Helium's command format and Mojang's command format.

It is only applicable to protocol versions V13 and upwards; but is unchanged there.

Format information can be found [here](https://wiki.vg/Command_Data) - again, the format is *version-independent.*
